      "excerpt"   : "The Belogorsk fortress was situated at a distance of forty versts from Orenburg. The road lay along the steep bank of the Yaik. The river was not yet frozen over, and its leaden currentshowed dark and dreary between the monotonous snow-coveredbanks. ON either side stretched the Kirghisz steppe. I was plunged in meditation, for the greaer part melancholy. Garrison lifeheld few attractions for me. I tried to imagine what CaptainMironov, my future superior officer, would be like, and formeda picture of a severe, bad-tempered old man, oblivious to all but the service, and ready to arrest me and put me on bread andwater for the most trivial offence. The dusk was beginning tofall. We were driving at a fair speed. “Is it far to the fortress?”I asked my driver. “Not very,” he replied.  “It’s just comming into sight, yonder.” I looked all around me, expecting to see formidablebastions, turrets, and ramparts; but I could see nothing but a huddle of wooden buildings surrounded by a log fence.On one side of the road were three or four haystacks, half-covered with snow, on the other a tumble-down mill with idlydrooping bark sails. “Where’s the fortress?” I asked in surprise.“There it is,” replied the driver, pointing to the hamlet into which we were turning at that moment.",

Bad decision. Scott is one of those rare directors who can take anything and make it into a one of a kind movie you’ll remember for ever. Oh yeah, five years from now I’ll remember the Martian alright, not Gravity. Just so I won’t forget anything let me write down the story.",

Yes, Summerhills could do that to you. A city has little pity being made up of people who have too much of that. Why that’s so I don’t know. Anyway, they were found dead. Seven dead men. No one thought much of it although the under taker would have told you there were blisters all over their skin. It starts as an itching. Then it puffs up and blisters. You wake up one night and find out your sheets covered in blood like there’d been murder done and hid. The fever starts in two days. You turn over in your sleep starts mumbling. Then the chills set in and you shake all the more.  It starts down inside of you and quickly builds up until the kings own fire cannot keep you warm. Death comes knocking in the morning.
